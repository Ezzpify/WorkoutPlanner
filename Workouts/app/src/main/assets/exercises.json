It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstrings, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip."

    "exerciseDescription": "The step-up with knee raise is a lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It differs from a traditional step-up in that at the top, you lift the trailing leg up to full hip flexion. This gives the exercise a greater range of motion and more of a focus on powerful hip extension in the working leg. When performed with body weight, these are usually performed for high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up, as cardio acceleration, or as part of the lower-body portion of a workout or circuit."

    "exerciseDescription": "The incline anti-gravity shoulder press is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders and upper back. It works the rear delts and upper-back muscles isometrically to hold the weight up, while dynamically training the lateral and front delts. Because of the challenge of holding the weight up, this press variation is usually performed with relatively light weights for moderate reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder training."

It&#x27;s the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher."

    "exerciseLink": "https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/barbell-incline-shoulder-raise",
    "exerciseDescription": "The incline barbell shoulder protraction is an upper-body movement that targets strength and mobility in the scapula or shoulder blades. This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."

    "exerciseDescription": "The negative pull-up is a multijoint bodyweight exercise that focuses on just one half of the traditional pull-up: the lowering, eccentric, or &quot;negative&quot; portion. Because muscles are stronger eccentrically than they are concentrically, many people can perform negatives even if they can&#x27;t perform full pull-ups. For this reason, it is a popular training tool to help people earn their first pull-up rep, or as a back-off exercise after doing full pull-ups."

    "exerciseDescription": "The lying leg curl is a popular machine-based exercise for the legs, particularly the hamstrings. It is similar to the seated leg curl, but the open hip angle in the lying leg curl may incorporate more glute and calf activation. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a leg pre-exhaust or as a muscle-building movement for lower-body training."

    "exerciseDescription": "The single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift is a movement targeting the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and back. The difference between a Romanian deadlift and a stiff-legged deadlift is the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support."

It&#x27;s the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher."

Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it&#x27;s slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can&#x27;t perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing."

    "exerciseDescription": "The incline dumbbell fly and press is a dumbbell complex that targets the chest muscles, particularly the upper pecs. By alternating the single-joint fly with the multijoint press, you get the benefits of both and put serious stress on the chest muscles even with relatively light weight. Because the fly will be the limiting factor in weight selection, this pairing is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or chest-focused training."

The trap bar deadlift can be trained in traditional strength and muscle-focused rep range, or for higher reps. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstring, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip."

With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher."

It also targets the biceps to a lesser degree. The cable row can work well in a variety of rep-ranges, but is most popular in muscle-building workouts or as an accessory movement for strength workouts."

    "exerciseDescription": "The straight-arm rope pull-down is a variation of the straight-arm lat pull-down performed using a cable stack machine and a rope grip. It can either be performed in an athletic upright stance, or slightly bent-over. It both stretches and contracts the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi) as well as providing additional activation to the other upper back muscles and the core. Because the triceps are also isometrically involved in the movement, it is usually performed for higher reps, like 8-15 reps or above."

It targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but the body angle makes it more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank first."
